                    Australopithecus afarensis

                    Australopithecus afarensis is an extinct hominid that lived between 
                    3.9 and 2.9 million years ago. Australopithecus afarensis was slenderly
                     built, like the younger Australopithecus africanus. It is thought that 
                     Australopithecus afarensis was more closely related to the genus Homo 
                     (which includes the modern human species Homo sapiens), whether as a 
                     direct ancestor or a close relative of an unknown ancestor,
                      than any other known primate from the same time.

                    The most famous fossil is the partial skeleton named Lucy
                     (3.2 million years old) found by Donald Johanson and colleagues, who,
                      in celebration of their find, repeatedly played the Beatles song Lucy
                       in the Sky with Diamonds. (Source: Wikipedia)

                    The australopithecines, or southern apes, include a wide range of fossil 
                    species that existed in Africa around 4.2 to 1 million years ago.
                     Their common characteristic is bipedalism, which places them within 
                     the human lineage. With a skeletal morphology and specific features 
                     of the jaws and teeth (dental arch and canine reduction) Australopithecus
                      can no longer be designated as an early ape. However, the reduced brain 
                      volume also means it cannot be referred to as a human either.
                 </p>
                  <p>
                    These are the first hominids to have small canine teeth and a body adapted to bipedal walking.
                     They do not belong, however, to the human race: the low brain volume (400 cm3 for Lucy, 1300 
                     cm3 for modern man), their powerful chinless face and flat nose more closely reflect current apes.
                     The skeleton of Lucy has allowed us to reconstruct their body and way of walking: the Australopithicans
                      had a broad chest and relatively long arms compared to the legs, a unique feature in the history of hominids.
                       Lucy walking with waddling small steps and by putting her feet flat on the ground, 
                       she could not run or stand for long periods.
                     However, she could easily hang from branches and move about in the trees to feed, rest and escape predators.
                     3.5 million years old, the fossil has no associated lithic industriy. Some anthropologists consider 
                     this the direct ancestor of Homo habilis, because of its slender form.
