  - All the content of project  accessible and the text is readable for the users. 
  - The form required in enteries in every input field. 
  - All link and submitt buttons works perfectly.


## Bugs

- I wrote the media query screen width only between 480px and 768px, but the image sizes become larger in less than 320px width mobile devices. So I rewrite the media query and divided to different sizes like less than 320px, 320px to 480px, 480px to 600px, 600px to 800px, 800px to 1024px and above. 
-The media List couldn't fit the screen size in mobile size, so I use basic JavaScript to show and hide the sidebar of the navigation out of the course requirement.

## Validator Testing 
 
  * HTML
    - All pages have passes the official W3C validator test with out any error.

  * CSS 
    - No error has found when passing official CSS (jgsaw) validator.

  * Accessibility 

    - I confirmed that all the colors and fonts are easily readable by running it through lighthouse devtools.
